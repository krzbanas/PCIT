SYNAPSE Inauguration




 “Synchrotron for Neuroscience – an Asia Pacific Strategic Enterprise” (SYNAPSE) is a coalition of synchrotron facilities including Pohang Light Source (Korea), Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, SPring-8 (Japan), Singapore Synchrotron Light Source, Taiwan Photon Source and Australia Synchrotron under the Asia Oceania Forum for Synchrotron Radiation Research (AOFSRR), with support from the local synchrotron, neurobiology and computing communities. SYNAPSE was officially launched on 15th January 2020.

The main objective of this coalition is to comprehensively map the neuron network of an entire human brain at sub-cellular level to reveal the connections. This historical target is made possible by the recent performances of synchrotron x-ray microscopy: 0.3 $\mu m$ resolution at 1 mm$^3$/min image taking speed. However, mapping one human brain would take a very long time and generate a huge amount of data. To overcome problems, SYNAPSE adopts a strategy of simultaneous image acquisition by several synchrotrons and coordinated data management. SYNAPSE will also use other advanced imaging techniques besides synchrotron microscopy: infrared spectromicroscopy, super-resolution visible light 3D microscopy and cryo-electron tomography.
