Analysis of elemental concentration of the material deposited onto air filters is an important application of X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF). In addition to the other components of deposit, particular attention focuses on heavy metals content. The identity and the concentration levels of these metals are of obvious concern for ecological and toxicological reasons. Precise information regarding the identification of pollutant can frequently help trace them back to their origin. XRF technique performed at synchrotron facilities can offer very quick analysis of samples without any prior preparation due to brightness of the synchrotron radiation. For the analytical report, careful analysis of obtained spectra is required. Reference-free solution based on calculations (by using theoretical cross-sections and geometric parameters of the setup of the experiment) is preferable.
At Phase Contrast Imaging and Tomography (PCIT) beam-line of Singapore Synchrotron Light Source (SSLS), X-ray beam of the energy range from 2 to 12 keV is mostly used for tomography and imaging experiments. However, using of photon energy dispersive silicon drift detector (XR-100SDD produced by Amptek company) enables also XRF spectroscopic measurements.
Preliminary data collection and evaluation show that the filter samples contain in Zn (KÎ± line photon energy 8.64 keV), Fe (6.4 keV), Mn (5.9 keV), Ti (4.51 keV), K (3.31 keV) and S (2.31 keV). Additionally, there is an indication of the presence of Ca, Cl and Br. There are also small differences in relative concentrations between the various filter samples collected in various time and space points. In order to gain additional information more experiments and statistical analysis of the obtained results is required.
