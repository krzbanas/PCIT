Presented research was done in collaboration with dr Sreekumar Pisharath and dr Zhang Fan from Energetics Research Institute, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore

X-ray tomography is a method of choice for the estimation of pore size distribution and thus the porosity of various materials. Phase Contrast Imaging and Tomography (PCIT) beam-line of Singapore Synchrotron Light Source (SSLS) features a white beam of X-rays with an energy range of about 4 - 12 keV, that is suitable for the experiments on soft matter (biological samples and polymers). 
One of the recently investigated topics was the estimation of void spaces in mock propellant composites (Hydroxy Terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB) polymer and ammonium chloride fillers). Propellants are highly filled polymer composites consisting of an energetic filler and binder, as their main components. Porosity is a critical microstructural feature of the propellant formed by chemical reaction between the components and subsequent processing. High porosity leads to poor mechanical and safety properties. Therefore, it is extremely important to study the development of porosity in mock propellant composites (without energetic fillers) as a function of the formulation, processing and ageing in propellant composites.
